Description: Turn a chroot environment into a bootable image
 debootstick is used to generate a bootable image from a Debian
 or Ubuntu chroot environment (such as one generated with
 debootstrap, docker export, etc.).
 This image should then be copied to a USB stick or disk and
 used to boot any amd64 machine (BIOS- or UEFI-based).
 debootstick can also generate an SD card image for a
 raspberry pi board.
 The embedded system is ready to be started live (no
 installation procedure needed), and is fully upgradeable
 (kernel and bootloader included).
